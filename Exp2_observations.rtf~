"CHOSE DIE" -> need to clairfiy that the player specifically picked a die and not randomly took one from the bag


if you can choose which die you want, you don't need to see the outcome of the roll. (just choose the all-blue die.)nalso, it seems in this game, even if you play honestly, you can play a winning strategy just by choosing blue every time.

	Using probability in explanation


In a casino, it would be very hard to get by with the player choosing the die due to all of the security measures. However, if the player was able to see the die, he/she would have a better chance of winning if any die except the 10red/10blue die was chosen.

	Takes into account "difficulty of cheating" and probability


It is my understanding that to cheat one would need to see the results before betting on a color. It is not clear that the die differ from each other.

	Confusion betwee
