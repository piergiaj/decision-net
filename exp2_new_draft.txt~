You see some friends, Alice and Bob, playing a game with dice. The game consists of the 2 players taking turing drawing a die from a bag, guessing a color and rolling the die. The player writes his guess on a piece of paper and hides it until the result of the die roll is known. If the color the player guessed matches the color the player rolled, the player gets a point. After a few rounds, the player with more points wins. There are 6 dice in the bag (maybe list them or maybe not list them, but give description like 20 sided die, varring amounts of blue and red sides):

	All 20 sides are blue
	18 blue sides, 2 red sides
	16 blue sides, 4 red sides
	14 blue sides, 6 red sides
	12 blue sides, 8 red sides
	10 blue sides, 10 red sides

The next day you here Alice complaining the Bob won again. She believes that Bob is cheating because he always wins. Alices's friends each have a different suggestion as to why Bob always wins, and all are equally difficult for Bob to perform. Which suggestion do you think best explains Bob's behavior?

  Name suggests that Bob randomly draws a die from the bag, he doesn't know which die he chose, but he has 2 papers, one for red and one for blue, that he shows to Alice after seeing the result of the roll.
